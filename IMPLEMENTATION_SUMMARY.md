## 📈 Database Queries Used

### Complex Aggregations:
```javascript
// Average rating calculation
db.comments.aggregate([
  { $match: { movieId: ObjectId } },
  { $group: { _id: null, avgRating: { $avg: '$rating' } } }
])

// Trending analysis (last 7 days)
db.users.aggregate([
  { $match: { 'watchHistory.watchedAt': { $gte: sevenDaysAgo } } },
  { $unwind: '$watchHistory' },
  { $group: { _id: '$watchHistory.movieId', count: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { count: -1 } }
])

// Personalized recommendations with genre scoring
db.users.findById(userId)
  .select('watchHistory watchlist favoriteMovies')
  .then(extractGenres)
  .then(weightGenres)
  .then(findMovies)
```
